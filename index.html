                Looking forward to start my career as web developer
                
            </p>
            <p>
                I started learning how to code by the beginning of <em>2022</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                I am a passionate developer 
                and career changer who experienced the transformational power of online learning 
                and find it fun. the development process is not only a job but it feels fun and 
                exciting to me when I am coding and building something.
            </p>
            <p>
                I started coding in the past few months so getting into Udacity Nano Degree was a 
                challenge for me but because I love coding, I stand for every step with patience to 
                get a good understanding of what I am learning, and building a real-life projects 
                with experts review was the perfect experience to me as a junior programmer, 
                solving problems seems stressful but I am a fighter at this point who will not stop 
                until solving or even contribute to any part that helps solve the problem because 
                the more important than only working is to get the job done perfectly as desired.
            </p>
            <p>
                After completing the Udacity Nano degree I learned that programming is not only 
                about learning how to code itâ€™s about getting my hand wet with coding and trying 
                and facing problems that what build the programmer mindset, so I am preparing 
                myself for new challenges to solve more advanced problems.
